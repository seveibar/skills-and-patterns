# README Customer Release

Before building a project, a customer release should be written. A customer release describes a product
as it would appeal to a customer.

Amazon does this for internal and external projects, you can see an example on any of their product pages. Check
out the one for their [database management](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).

> A customer release README should follow all the practices laid out in [good READMEs](https://github.com/waoai/skills-and-patterns/tree/master/good-readmes).
