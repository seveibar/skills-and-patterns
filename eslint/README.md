# eslint

eslint is a utility for verifying that javascript does not contain anti-patterns. We use the `react-app` eslint config,
although this will probably change because this config has some minor issues with `useEffect`.


```javascript
// ...
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
  },
// ...
```
