# Skills and Patterns

These are skills and patterns for waoai developers. They should be used as a reference
whereever possible or useful.

## How much of this should I know?

You should know everything here. A lot of it is learned in application, so it might take a while
for things to sink in.

## Why did we pick XXX over YYY?

Open a PR, start a discussion. The patterns and technology here are mostly based on @seveibar's years
of building open-source and startup applications, with some applications used by hundreds of thousands
of people a year. Eventually it'll be based on a collective discussion.

## Proposing Changes

Open a PR to start a discussion.

Technology choices and patterns are always opinionated. Patterns and technologies evolve and so should these
documents. Still, you must be an expert in what you are replacing to make a case for it's replacement. So
if you want to replace Postgres with MongoDB, or Material UI with Semantic UI, or $PROVEN_TECH with $TECH_OF_MONTH,
you'll need to have serious chops in BOTH technologies.
