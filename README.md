# Skills and Patterns

These are skills and patterns for waoai developers. They should be used as a reference
whereever possible or useful.


## Proposing Changes

Technology choices and patterns are always opinionated. Patterns and technologies evolve and so should these
documents. Still, you must be an expert in what you are replacing to make a case for it's replacement. So
if you want to replace Postgres with MongoDB, or Material UI with Semantic UI, or $PROVEN_TECH with $TECH_OF_MONTH,
you'll need to have serious chops in BOTH technologies.
