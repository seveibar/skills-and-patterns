# User Empathy

User empathy is understanding deeply the user's experience and pain points.

To have user empathy:
* You must understand exactly how user's are using the product
* You must watch user's using the product
* You must replicate user actions on the product
* You must seek to delight your users


## Anti-pattern: Checklist Features

A "checklist feature" is a feature that is "checked off" as being done because
it _technically_ meets the requirement to state that the product has a feature,
but does not necessarily solve the problem in the best way, or in a way that's
actually useful.

An example of this is building a tool that lets a user draw boxes over an image,
but requiring the user hit 5 buttons for every box they want to draw. In this case,
the developer has technically completed the feature, but does not care about creating
it in a way that delights the user.
