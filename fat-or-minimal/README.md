# Fat or Minimal (Dependencies)

There are two dominating philosophies when building projects. One is to keep dependencies as minimal as possible,
another is to import anything to get the job done. Both of these attitudes are advantageous in different scenarios.

Each project has a designation as fat or minimal. If the project does not say "minimal", it is by default fat.

## Choosing Fat vs Minimal

When building a library, it is usually better to be minimal. When building an app, it is usually better to be fat.

When a project must be developed quickly it should be fat.
