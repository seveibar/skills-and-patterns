# Cloud9

[Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a browser IDE and virtual machine service hosted by AWS. Whenever peer-programming,
use the Cloud9 IDE.

## Anti-pattern: IDE-specific Peer Programming

There are many collaborative extensions for atom, VS Code, vim, ssh, etc. These take too long to set up and are prone to
local installation issues. They also don't provide virtual machines.
