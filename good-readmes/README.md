# READMEs

The `README.md` file at the top of any project dramatically effects how many people will use an application or library,
as well as how easy it is to contribute to. For both internal and external projects, good `README`s are a requirement.

Things that are in every good README:
* A descriptive line at the top that summarizes exactly what the project helps the user with
* Getting started instructions (with simple example)
* A section breakdown based on various use cases
* Relevant API documentation
* An animated GIF for projects with a GUI

Things that are good to have:
* Wiki links for help with specific topics
* Link to Slack or community forum
* Instructions for how to develop
* Link to Contributing Guide (with video on how to contribute)
